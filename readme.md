## Setup

...

## MVP

create a basic application for a superhero enthusiast, that can perform following functions:

1. Allow a user to search for their favourite superhero.
2. Select the superhero and see his/her image and power stats.
3. Edit the power stats
4. Save the image and stats to be viewed later.

So, essentially the app would allow a user to search superheroes by name, see his/her details, edit them and view all their saved super heroes.

You can use https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/ for fetching super hero details
Our preferable stack is ReactJS, GraphQL, NodeJS and dynamodb, but feel free to use a different stack until you use NodeJS for back-end.
Please document all the assumptions you made and technical challenges you faced when doing this task.

Also add a Readme to allow us to run the app locally (Or you can also deploy it, and make things easier for us, but that is not a mandatory requirement)

## Notes

-   Lambda can save money as you pay for cycles used instead of hosting.
-   Cold starts mean slower response.
-   More difficult to test.
